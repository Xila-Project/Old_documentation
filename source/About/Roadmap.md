# ðŸš† Roadmap

- Support more hardware :
  - Teensy
  - ESP8266
  - Arduino Protenta H7
  - STM32 (BluePill, Nucleo ...)
- Add virtual memory system to isolate softwares (maybe too much for the ESP32 ?).
- Change file system (LittleFS ?).
- Use a lightweight configuration file format (JSON is too heavy parse).
- Add material design.
- Add support for translations.
