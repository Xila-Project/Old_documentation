# 👋 Welcome to the documentation of Xila

# 📬 Introduction

Xila is an open-source operating system aimed at embedded systems that provides a user-friendly interface with powerful features.
It is designed to run on microcontroller with limited resources while providing efficient and scalable performance.
The project aims to provide a fully functional operating system that can perform tasks such as multitasking, memory management, input-output handling, and file system management in constrained environments.

With Xila, developers can build applications for all sorts of end-devices like robotics, smart home automation, wearables, and much more.
Xila provides its users with a structured API, a high-level programming language, powerful tools, and clear documentation for ease of use and integration.

The key objective of the project is to make development faster by leveraging Xila’s modular architecture, expandable library of drivers and libraries, and well-documented codebase.
By utilizing these tools, developers can rapidly prototype and deploy new products without worrying about lower-level details.
