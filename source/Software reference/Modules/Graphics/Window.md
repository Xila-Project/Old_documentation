# `Window_Type`

## ðŸ‘“ Overview

`Window_Type` is the parent class of all the graphics elements for a software. When creating the parent window of a software, you have to pass the owner software. This way, the Window, the owner user are recorded and the window is created in the user's screen (see `Screen_Type`).

You can also create a sub-window by passing a parent window with the regular `Window_Type:Create` method.

:::{warning}
The window is not automatically deleted when the software is closed. You have to delete it manually in the software destructor (all children will be deleted automatically).

It uses the following types :
- `Window_State_Type`

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```cpp
    using namespace Xila;

    void My_Software::Set_Interface()
    {
        Window_Type Window;
        Window.Create(this);
        Window.Set_Title("My Software");
        
        Label_Type Label;
        Label.Create(Window.Get_Body());
        Label.Set_Text("Hello World !");
        Label.Set_Alignment(Alignment_Type::Center);
