## Overview

Xila has a modular architecture which means that each system part is a module.
A module is a part of the system responsible for a specific task. It could be an hardware abstraction layer or a library.
This way, it's easier to add new features and to debug the system since it reduces coupling.

`Module_Type` is the base type that could be derived to create a module.

:::{note}
    `Software_Type` is also a child class of `Module_Type`.

:::{note}
    `Module_Type` is an alias of `Module_Class` (used by the internals).
