# üñ•Ô∏è Getting started with development

Here you will find how to get started with development on Xila.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- A [supported hardware](../../Hardware%20reference/Supported%20hardware.md).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Platform IO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) extension.

## üìñ Steps

1. **Clone** the xila repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlixANNERAUD/Xila.git --recursive
```
2. **Open** the cloned folder with Visual Studio Code.
```bash
code Xila
```
3. **Open** `Platform IO` and open the `Code` folder as a project.
:::{tip}
This operation can take a while since Platform IO have to download all the libraries.

4. **Change** the **selected environment** to the one corresponding to your hardware.
